# atomorph
Image morphing library that uses fluid dynamics and optimal transport to produce intuitive morphs.

http://atomorph.org

AtoMorph Library uses the C++11 standard. The included Makefiles
have been tested on Linux operating systems. iOS users may encounter
some problems due to poor support of the C++11 standard on their
system. One should try modifying the Makefile by adding -std=gnu++11 
and -stdlib=libc++ compiler flags.

Build instructions:    
    Run make in this folder.

Example usage:
