ImageMagick is needed for these tests to run properly:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing 

The completion of all of the tests requires approximately 10 minutes.
However, some of the individual tests finish within seconds. Feel free
to examine the test scripts and modify the parameters.
